# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.

# Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.

# Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.

# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called weather_f that takes each temperature in degrees Celsius and converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.

# To convert temp_c into temp_f use this formula:

# (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f

temps ={"Monday": 12, "Tuesday": 14, "Wednesday": 15, "Thursday": 14, "Friday": 21, "Saturday": 22, "Sunday": 24}

# Write your code ðŸ‘‡ below:
